Greetings user, welcome to the guide to help you use the calculator; Here are the currently supported functions with
the next list being operations coming in the future if you have any questions regarding functionality please email me
at newbgr78@gwd50.org for further assistance:

To switch between f(x) and g(x) please click enter;
#Note there is no implicit multiplication so * must be used for any operation requiring implicit multiplication 
*********LIST OF APPROVED FUNCTIONS AND SYMBOLS*************

1. The trig functions, sin, cos, tan,cot,sec, and csc | Must be written as trigFunc(expression) EX sin(x) or sin(3*x);
2. Basic Binary Operations (+, -, *, /, %, ^, sqrt, nthroot) | Note nthroot must be written as nthroot(undRad, outRad)
EX: nthroot(64, 3) gives 4 as a result;
3. Math.Floor and Math.Ceiling are supported, in decimal rounding rather than just Math.round.
4. Logarithms are supported as well in the format of: log(quantity, base) EX log(8, 2) gives 3; Natural logs are 
supported by going through the log function and using 2.718 for e EX ln(x) = log(x, 2.718).

************************************************************


*********LIST OF COMING FUNCTIONS AND SYMBOLS***************
1. The natural log function and the use of constant e | symbols being ln(expression) and e^expression

2. Derivatives of functions | Will be denoted as dx(expression) result will be shown in first quadrant of graph

3. Definite Integrals | Symbol already programmed along with logic but graphical display must be created denoted as
int(expression); ***FUNCTIONALITY ALREADY IN PLACE PLEASE SEE "IntegralCalculator.txt" for more information about 
functionality and running the program in the command prompt for the time being :^)

4. Implict Multiplication... will hopefully happen one day

When exploring the contents of the folder please ignore "CHANGELOG.TXT" if you so wish as this is present to help 
document previous changes to the main CalculusJar.jar.
